I used Bootstrap to create my responsiveness. I justed Javascript in my responsive nav and created a hamburger in mobile size.
I also have Javascript fade in and out a testimonial area at the bottom of the page.

In my CSS file I have resized and recolored many of the assets on my page. I changed the font families as well.
